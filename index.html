<big>CHEMISTRY</big>

<br />
<P>One of the most debated concepts in chemistry is whether water itself is wet. The answer? Not really. Wetness is a term we use when a liquid adheres to a surface. So, while water can make other things wet, water itself isn’t wet. This interesting perspective flips the way we think about liquids in general.
    A number of classical texts, like
Atharvaveda (1000 BCE) mention some dye
stuff, the material used were turmeric, madder,
sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some
other substances having tinting property were
kamplcica, pattanga and jatuka.
Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita gives
references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes
for hair dying were made from plants, like
indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron
or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel.
Gandhayukli describes recipes for making
scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders,
incense and talcum power.
Paper was known to India in the
17th century as account of Chinese traveller
I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate
that ink was used in India from the fourth
century. Colours of ink were made from chalk,
red lead and minimum.
It seems that the process of fermentation
was well-known to Indians. Vedas and
Kautilya’s Arthashastra mention about many
types of liquors. Charaka Samhita also
mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants,
stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and
sugarcane for making Asavas.
The concept that matter is ultimately made
of indivisible building blocks, appeared in
India a few centuries BCE as a part of
philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda,
born in 600 BCE, originally known by the
name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the
‘atomic theory’. He formulated the theory of
very small indivisible particles, which he
named ‘Paramãnu’ (comparable to atoms). He
authored the text Vaiseshika Sutras.
According to him, all substances are
aggregated form of smaller units called atoms
(Paramãnu), which are eternal, indestructible,
spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the
original state. He explained that this individual
entity cannot be sensed through any human
organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of
atoms that are as different as the different
classes of substances. He said these
(Paramãnu) could form pairs or triplets, among
other combinations and unseen forces cause
interaction between them. He conceptualised
this theory around 2500 years before John
Dalton (1766-1844).
Charaka Samhita is the oldest Ayurvedic
epic of India. It describes the treatment of
diseases. The concept of reduction of particle
size of metals is clearly discussed in Charaka
Samhita. Extreme reduction of particle size is
termed as nanotechnology. Charaka Samhita
describes the use of bhasma of metals in the
treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been
proved that bhasmas have nanoparticles of
metals.
After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry
reached a steady state, but it too declined due
to the introduction and practise of western
medicinal system in the 20th century. During
this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical
industry based on Ayurveda continued to
exist, but it too declined gradually. It took
about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and
adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign
products poured in. As a result, indigenous
traditional techniques gradually declined.
Modern science appeared in Indian scene in
the later part of the nineteenth century. By the
mid-nineteenth century, European scientists
started coming to India and modern chemistry
started growing.
From the above discussion, you have learnt
that chemistry deals with the composition,
structure, properties and interection of matter
and is of much use to human beings in daily
life. These aspects can be best described and
understood in terms of basic constituents of
matter that are atoms and molecules. That
is why, chemistry is also called the science of
atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and
perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)?
Is it possible to count the number of atoms
and molecules in a given mass of matter and
have a quantitative relationship between the
mass and the number of these particles? We
will get the answer of some of these questions
in this Unit. We will further describe how
physical properties of matter can be
quantitatively described using numerical
